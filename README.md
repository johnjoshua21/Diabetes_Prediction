🏥 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 *Project Overview*

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on key health indicators. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms on a dataset containing medical records. The objective is to assist in early diagnosis and risk assessment.


🛠️ *Technologies Used*
Python

Pandas & NumPy (Data Preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook


📊 *Dataset Description*
The dataset includes features such as:

Pregnancies – Number of times pregnant

Glucose – Plasma glucose concentration

Blood Pressure – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness – Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin – 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI – Body Mass Index

Diabetes Pedigree Function – Likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age – Age of the individual

Outcome – (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)


🚀 *Machine Learning Workflow*

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying patterns and correlations.
Model Training – Using classification algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model Evaluation – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Predictions & Insights – Deploying the best-performing model.
